# Python Chat Room Project with Flask Framework and SocketIO
This Python chat room project is built with the Flask web framework and SocketIO library for real-time communication. The front-end is implemented with JavaScript.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a chat room web application where users can chat with each other in real-time. Users can join different chat rooms and send messages to other users in the same room. The chat room interface is implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the SocketIO library for real-time communication with the server.

The project is built with the Flask web framework, which provides a lightweight and flexible environment for building web applications in Python. The SocketIO library is used to enable real-time communication between the client and server, allowing messages to be sent and received in real-time without the need for constant polling.
